\section{Introduction}

This project is a comparative study of alternatives to elearning.

The major goals of elearning are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item reduce as much as possible the quality/price ratio of current learning material
  \item create new experiences for users which were not possible in the usual class-room configuration
\end{itemize}

After the requirements are defined, the most promising alternatives to reaching as many those requirements as possible will be studied. Great focus will be given to modifying existing methods for the uses of elearning.

After the alternatives have been analysed, I will implement as much as I can of what I conclude to be the most promising alternative and then present what I have been able to implement.
